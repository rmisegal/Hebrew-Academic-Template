Here is the structured set of instructions, updated with the new requirements, and presented in plain text with a professional and official tone.

Task Objectives and Scope

The primary objective is to create a complete, fully compilable Hebrew LaTeX book project using the specific custom class file, "hebrew-academic-template.cls". These tasks outline the process of analyzing the provided example files and class functions to ensure correct implementation of mixed Hebrew (RTL) and English/Formula (LTR) content, proper structure, and specific IEEE-formatted bibliography handling, with all verifications done at the final PDF level.

Project Setup and Analysis Tasks

1. Project Class File Acquisition
Task 1.1: Locate and copy the required custom class file: "hebrew-academic-template.cls".
Task 1.2: Place "hebrew-academic-template.cls" into the new LaTeX project directory.

2. Example File Review and Learning
Task 2.1: Identify all example LaTeX (".tex") files provided in the example folder.
Task 2.2: Open and thoroughly read the instructional Markdown file(s) for the CLS usage.
Task 2.3: Analyze each example ".tex" file to identify CLS function calls and their corresponding output structure.
Task 2.4: Examine the example bibliography (".bib") file to understand its specific structure.

3. Content and Font Preparation
Task 3.1: Verify the CLS is configured to support existing Hebrew Windows 11 fonts.
Task 3.2: Confirm that the CLS uses Unicode encoding for text.
Task 3.3: Prepare to receive the final book content for conversion.

4. CLS Functionality Mastery (Directionality and Mixing)
Task 4.1: Study the example of mixing Hebrew (RTL) and English (LTR) text within a paragraph.
Task 4.2: Learn how to embed formulas in LTR direction using the prescribed CLS function.
Task 4.3: Study how to ensure Hebrew text used within a Formula mode remains RTL.
Task 4.4: Learn how to ensure all code sentences and file structures are written only in English LTR.
Task 4.5: Analyze the method for mixing Hebrew and English content within a single table cell using plain text or "\mixedcell{}".
Task 4.6: Understand how to set titles and subtitle numbering in LTR using the CLS functions.
Task 4.7: Study the examples for keeping the main part of the title in Hebrew (RTL), mixed with English and LTR formulas.

5. Table and Image Mastering
Task 5.1: Learn how to set table column order manually so that column 1 is the most right column.
Task 5.2: Study the use of "\mixedcell{\textbf{Hebrew / \en{English}}}" for table headers to maintain RTL direction.
Task 5.3: Learn how to format table titles to be centered, above the table, with Hebrew in RTL and English/numbers/formula variables in LTR.
Task 5.4: Learn how to format image titles to be centered, under the image, with Hebrew in RTL and English/numbers/formula variables in LTR.

6. Bibliography and Citation Mastery
Task 6.1: Learn the exact CLS function used for the unique bibliography structure of this project.
Task 6.2: Study the CLS function required to generate IEEE-format citations.
Task 6.3: Analyze the process of inserting numbered citations in the body text.

7. Initial Project Setup and Compilation Readiness
Task 7.1: Create a minimal, working LaTeX root file (e.g., "main.tex") using the "hebrew-academic-template.cls".
Task 7.2: Insert a placeholder section and entry for a Table of Contents.
Task 7.3: Insert a placeholder title and a single paragraph of mixed Hebrew and English text using the learned CLS functions.
Task 7.4: Insert a simple placeholder table using the column order, header, and title rules (Tasks 5.1, 5.2, 5.3).
Task 7.5: Insert a single placeholder reference into a new ".bib" file following the unique project structure.
Task 7.6: Insert a citation for the placeholder reference in the body text using the required CLS citation function.

8. Final Action
Task 8.1: Request the final content file or location from the user.

Test List

Note: All tests must be checked and verified at the PDF output level.

Test ID: T1
Tasks Checked: 1.1, 1.2, 7.1
Description of Test: Verify the core document structure.
Passing Criteria: The document compiles without errors using "\documentclass{hebrew-academic-template}" and generates a basic ".pdf" output.

Test ID: T2
Tasks Checked: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 7.3
Description of Test: Verify general directionality mixing and formula behavior.
Passing Criteria: In the PDF, a test paragraph (Task 7.3) successfully renders with Hebrew text in RTL, embedded LTR English/Formulas, and any Hebrew text used inside a formula mode is rendered RTL. All code sentences and file structures are LTR.

Test ID: T3
Tasks Checked: 4.6, 4.7
Description of Test: Verify title formatting.
Passing Criteria: In the PDF, the main title is rendered in Hebrew (RTL), but the title/subtitle numbering is in LTR.

Test ID: T4
Tasks Checked: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.5, 7.6
Description of Test: Verify bibliography compilation and output.
Passing Criteria: The document is compiled with the correct sequence and the PDF contains a **Reference List (e)** and a **numbered citation** (Task 7.6) in the body text, both following IEEE format.

Test ID: T5
Tasks Checked: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 7.4
Description of Test: Verify table structure, column order, and header/title formatting.
Passing Criteria: In the PDF, the placeholder table (Task 7.4) displays column 1 as the rightmost column. The table header uses "\mixedcell" correctly to keep the RTL direction. The table title is centered, above the table, with Hebrew in RTL and English/variables in LTR.

Test ID: T6
Tasks Checked: 5.4
Description of Test: Verify image title formatting.
Passing Criteria: In the PDF, a test image title (if present) is centered, under the image, with Hebrew in RTL and English/variables in LTR.

Test ID: T7
Tasks Checked: 7.2
Description of Test: Verify Table of Contents (TOC) existence.
Passing Criteria: The PDF contains a generated Table of Contents (TOC) (d).

Would you like me to give you the final content file or location so I can begin working on Task 7.1?
